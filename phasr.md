got a curated TE list from Almo: D_mel_transposon_sequence_set.fa
concatinate this to the file dmel-all-chromosome-r6.57.fasta from https://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/current/fasta by doing  
```cat D_mel_transposon_sequence_set.fa >> dmel-all-chromosome-r6.57.fasta```
upload dmel-all-chromosome-r6.57.fasta to vetlinux and do the mapping there:
